Model of mouse in AnimatLab

This code represents the research and collaboration of Lindie Burgess and Brita Hill during 
Spring quarter 2020 at Portland State University. We created a model of a mouse inspired by 
Dr. Hunt's rat model.

Our data on bone size, mass, and density, and muscle origin and insertion points 
were pulled from a variety of sources, but we relied primarily on the following resources: 

J. P. Charles, O. Cappellari, A. J. Spence, D. J. Wells, and J. R. Hutchinson, “Muscle moment arms and sensitivity analysis of a mouse hindlimb musculoskeletal model,” Journal of Anatomy, vol. 229, no. 4, pp. 514–535, Dec. 2016.
I. Bab, C. Hajbi-Yonissi, Y. Gabet, and R. Müller, “Micro-Tomographic Atlas of the Mouse Skeleton,” 2007.
F. Young, C. Rode, A. Hunt, and R. Quinn, “Analyzing Moment Arm Profiles in a Full-Muscle Rat Hindlimb Model,” Biomimetics, vol. 4, no. 1, p. 10, 2019.
E. C. Greene, “Anatomy Of The Rat,” The American Journal of the Medical Sciences, vol. 191, no. 6, p. 858, 1936.


Future augmentation of the model would include addition of more muscles, tuning to ensure those muscles
collaborate, and tuning of the CPG to induce a walking motion. 

Lot of thanks to Dr. Hunt for his guidance through this project!
